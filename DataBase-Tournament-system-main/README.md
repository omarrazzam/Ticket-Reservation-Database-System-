This system Manages matches Played in any sport and manages the fan system too.

-As a System Admin you can Add clubs or Stadiums or delete them and you can also block fans.

-As a Sports Association Manager you can create new matches between 2 different clubs from which any of the clubs involved can ask to host. you can also
delete Matches and view all history of any games played and view all clubs and those who have never played in a match.

-Every Club Has a single Representative That can view all data about their club and can request to host matches against another club on available stadiums.

-Every Stadium Has a single Manager That can view all data about their Stadium and has the freedom to accept or reject requests from club representatives.

translated it into a Realtional Schema

![Relational Schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108115289/213082178-d772e227-5b5f-4893-83f0-642a5d3d9ad2.png)


and Implemented it all into code. 

We've designed a front end to the system however so far this is just the backbone for the design that handles all exceptions and
procedures. I will be working further to translate it into a fully functional website with our desing in mind once I get the free time.
